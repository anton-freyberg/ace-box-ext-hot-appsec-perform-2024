# dt-operator

This currated role can be used to deploy Dynatrace k8s operator (Dynakube) with a Classic full-stack injection deployment strategy. 

Dynatrace Operator manages classic full-stack injection after the following resources are deployed.

- OneAgent, deployed as a DaemonSet, collects host metrics from Kubernetes nodes. It also detects new containers and injects OneAgent code modules into application pods.

- Dynatrace Activegate is used for routing, as well as for monitoring Kubernetes objects by collecting data (metrics, events, status) from the Kubernetes API.

- Dynatrace webhook server validates Dynakube definitions for correctness.
